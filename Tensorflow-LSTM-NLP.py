"""
tf.keras.layers.Embedding layer: This layer is used to convert the input text data into a dense vector representation. It takes an integer sequence as input, where each integer represents the index of a word in the vocabulary. It then maps each index to a dense vector representation of fixed size. The input_dim parameter specifies the size of the vocabulary, i.e., the number of distinct words in the input. The output_dim parameter specifies the size of the output dense vectors, which is a hyperparameter of the model.

tf.keras.layers.LSTM layer: This layer is a type of recurrent neural network layer that is used to process sequences of data. It takes the output of the Embedding layer as input and applies LSTM operations to it. The units parameter specifies the number of LSTM units in the layer. The dropout parameter specifies the dropout rate, which is a regularization technique that randomly sets some of the inputs to zero during training to prevent overfitting. The return_sequences parameter is set to True to return the output sequences of the layer, which are then processed by subsequent layers.

tf.keras.layers.Flatten layer: This layer is used to flatten the output of the previous LSTM layer into a 2D tensor, which can be used as input to a fully connected layer.

tf.keras.layers.RepeatVector layer: This layer is used to repeat the output of the previous Flatten layer for a fixed number of times, specified by the n parameter. This is done to match the length of the input sequence, which is necessary for the subsequent LSTM layer to process the sequence.

Another tf.keras.layers.LSTM layer: This layer is similar to the previous LSTM layer, but it takes the repeated output of the previous Flatten layer as input instead of the output of the Embedding layer. It also outputs a sequence of values, which are then processed by the next layer.

tf.keras.layers.TimeDistributed layer: This layer is used to apply a dense layer to each element of the output sequence of the previous LSTM layer. The Dense layer has a single unit with a sigmoid activation function, which is used to output a probability score for each element of the sequence.
